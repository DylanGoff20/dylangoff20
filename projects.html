                                        The purpose of this was to play games, but it resulted me becoming intersted in computers and choosing computer science as 
                                        a major in college.</p>

                                    <p>My and my team built predictive models in attempt to predict whether a student was going to drop out or not. 
                                     We used decision trees and k-nearest neighbors to find relations in students that dropped out of college vs those who did not.</p>

                                    <p>We wanted to find what factors play a role into season tickets pricing for some of the top NCAA division 1 basketball programs. 
                                    We used Exploratory Factor Analysis is attempts to find which factors play the biggest role into season ticket pricing, 
                                    and if we could predict the 2024 season ticket pricing based on our results.</p>
